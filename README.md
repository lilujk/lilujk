My name is Lilu Kaufman (she/her) and I'm an aspiring software engineer interested in full-stack development with experience in art and design. I hope to combine my creativity and my love for programming to advance the current capabilities of technologies with the goal of helping others. 

I thoroughly enjoy problem-solving and aim to use my imagination to allow me to view issues from fresh perspectives. I thrive on collaborating and value diverse POVs. My approach to issues involves addressing obstacles head-on in line with effective communication. I aspire to create a balance between my love for STEM and the arts while having a positive impact on communities worldwide.
